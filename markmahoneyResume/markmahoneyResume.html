				Professional Profile
			</h3>
			<p>
				Results-driven professor.Served as a senior software engineer at Motorola and an adjunct instructor of computer science at Roosevelt University prior to joining the Carthage faculty in 2002. His research interests are object-oriented technologies, aspect-orientation, state based systems, and software engineering. His work with Bluetooth Wireless Communication protocols resulted in algorithms for avoiding fixed interferers in Bluetooth radio bands. This work resulted in a patent.teaching database design, operating systems, and software engineering courses.Earned a B.in computer science from Roosevelt University, and a M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Illinois Institute of Technology.
